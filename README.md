pwnerblu UI is a text-based user interface designed to run with turdus merula's Linux build.
It is meant to make turdus merula easier to use. I'm not affiliated, sponsored, or endorsed by the original developers of turdus merula.
I also didn't create Turdus Merula originally.

To install this UI, make sure you have turdus merula's linux build on your PC. This interface will not work fully without turdus merula.
After downloading the UI, drag "pwnerblu-UI.sh" to the turdus merula Linux folder (turdus_merula_v1.0.1-1_linux).

There is currently support for A10 devices with this UI. A9 support isn't guaranteed with this interface yet (although turdus merula does support A9/A10).
This is a BETA. Please report any bugs you may have or any polishing suggestions.
Link to download turdus merula's Linux build (this is required for this UI to work): https://sep.lol/files/releases/test/v1.0.1-linux/turdus_merula_v1.0.1-1_linux.tar

You only have to use the link if you haven't downloaded the Linux version of turdus merula already.
The pwnerblu UI doesn't give you the option to do untethered downgrades yet. Currently, it only does tethered downgrades.

This does not mean turdus merula itself is limited to untethered downgrades.
It simply means that this UI script doesn't expose untethered options (yet).

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute to improvements for the interface script!
